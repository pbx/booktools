# Chapter 0: Example

Here's some Python code that does something:

<!-- excerpt example.py#1 -->

Here's some code from an HTML file:

<!-- excerpt example.html#1 -->


Here's another piece from that file:

<!-- excerpt example.html#2 -->

Here is some code that we want to test:

    >>> number_list = [15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
    >>> print number_list[:10]
    [15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10, 9, 8, 7, 6]

The end!
